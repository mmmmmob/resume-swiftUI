This project focuses on practicing essential SwiftUI syntaxes:

- HStack, VStack, and ZStack.
- Extending existing classes.
- Refactoring components into individual views.
- Using static functions in structs for repetition.
- Handling optional values safely.

**_For code improvement and refactoring details, check the [commit history](https://github.com/mmmmmob/swift-playground/commits/main/_Projects/Resume/Resume) in another repository._**
